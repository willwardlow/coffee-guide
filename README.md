### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Find, user and parse data from an external API
- Render data on page via various components. 
- Display information on page(s).
- Allow user to submit their own coffee reviews. User submission will populate on page.

#### PostMVP  

- Implement geotagging, allow users to provide location of the roastery's respective location. Or provide location via Google Maps
- A comment section, where users can comment on other user's submission.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: 
Pseudocoding and planning app fucnctionality. 

### Weaknesses: 
CSS and Designing layout that is appealing to users not myself.

### Opportunities: 
Effectively timeboxing errors and seeking assistance sooner than later.

### Threats: 
Effectively apply React knowledge gained in the past 1.5 weeks.
