## API and Data Sample

API Sample from Airtable

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "reczDPZqfpSmkmT1q",
            "fields": {

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Find, use, and parse data from an external API
- Render data on page via various components. 
- Display information on page(s).
- Allow user to submit their own coffee reviews. User submission will populate on page.

#### PostMVP  

- Implement geotagging, allow users to provide location of the roastery's respective location. Or provide location via Google Maps.
- Expand reviews, not just coffees, but cafes.
- A comment section, where users can comment on other user's submissions.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: 
Pseudocoding and planning app fucnctionality. I can create a clear plan of how I want the app to function and appear and can plan accordingly. 

### Weaknesses: 
CSS and Designing layout that is appealing to users not myself. I can take in account of the user experience in the planning and CSS, rather than before when I just want the functions to appear on the screen.

### Opportunities: 
Effectively timeboxing errors and seeking assistance sooner than later. Looking back on the Mad-Libs project, I spent more than time than necessary to fix bugs on my own rather than asking for assistance or a fresh pair of eyes to look at my code. 

### Threats: 
Effectively apply React knowledge gained in the past 1.5 weeks. The comfort in React may not be where I want it to be when taking on this project, and that is the source of the threat. Leveraging the strength in planning and pseudocoding and applying some research in components (functions vs class) can increase my comfort and in turn, confidence.
